A masters student in Statistics - keen to continuously learn about the statistical and data sciences. My journey so far has been nothing but exciting. It is with enthusiasm that I look forward to navigate further into the world of data science; to further explore areas ranging from classical statistical methods to artificial intelligence.

As any explorer would, I will post some of new findings and discoveries that I make during my journey [here](https://yovna26.github.io/blog/).
